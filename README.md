# L3: Beetle Game

### Authors: *Luke Wilson*

## Original Author: Jan Pearce, Berea College
## Code designed to deepen knowledge of design of OOP in C++
## Created for CSC 236 Data Structures at Berea College

1. **HIGH LEVEL DESIGN**
*Complete the high-level design components in the linked Google Doc.*

2. **CRC Cards**
*Complete the CRC Card in the linked Google Doc. 
*Paste link to completed Google Doc here.*

*FIhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1KVZ2oqghdL3WGjsSNVDL5VlwAGI7zU-U1HYRd1zOAYQ/edit#heading=h.c1x99npetnfuXME*

3. **OOP USABILITY**
*Was there anything that you tried that did not work? Explain.*

*I tried creating an array as an attribute for a class but that didn't. Everytime I played the game, the program would run into 
an error. I think I needed to set a pointer for the attribute to use an array as a default atrribute.'*

4. **PROCESS SUMMARY**
*Briefly summarize your design and implementation process,
including how much your initial design plan evolved,
the final results you achieved, and the amount of time you spent
as a programmer or programmers in accomplishing these results.
This should be one or at most two paragraphs.*

*I created a flow chart to help me under the high level design of the program.
I planned each method and the attributes of the beetle. I wanted 3 main methods of the beetle class. 
After I finished the CRC card and design plan I started working on the code. I fullfilled all
requirements for the implementation of the game (roll die, add part, display partial beetle). I 
spent probably around 12-15 hours on this lab.*

5. **DESIGN CHALLENGES**
*Describe the primary conceptual challenges that you encountered
in trying to complete this lab and what might have made the
lab easier for you.*

*The hardest part was displaying the partial beetle. I made it to where you could see the partial beetle with each turn. I forgot
you could edit certain characters in an indice string. I wish I would have remembered that during the lab.
It would have saved me from making a lot of conditional statements*

7. **ERRORS**
*List in bulleted form of all known errors
and deficiencies with a very brief explanation.*

- *The biggest error is when it doesn't cout an entire string for some reason'*

8. **LEARNING AND REACTION**
*A paragraph or so of your own comments
on what you learned and your reactions to this lab.*

*I learned that I need to make method prototypes because they're helpful for organization. I learned 
that arrays can be manipulated in different ways, such as editing an indice. I learned how to
overload operators and why overloading operators is important sometimes. I learned how to use get functions.
I learned that you need to take a brief break from coding if you're stuck on a certain task. I learned that it's
important to only focus on one task at a time when coding. My reaction of this lab: I feel I learned a lot 
and will be more prepared to do better on the next one.'*

9. **PAIRWORK STATEMENT**
If you worked in a pair of programmers, you are **required** to use 
good pair programming practices, always working together and not 
using a divide and conquer technique in which only one of you does 
the work and learns. Also, the two programmers roles should be switched 
frequently--around every 20 minutes or so. If you worked alone, please say so. 
If you worked in a pair, please describe how you worked together.

*worked alone*

9. **INTEGRITY STATEMENT**
*Please briefly describe ALL help you and (your parter) received and
all help you gave to others in completing this lab. Also list any other 

references below.*

*Dr. Mario Nakazawa: showed me how to use get functions
Anish Kharel: helped debug my main()*
